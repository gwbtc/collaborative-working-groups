# Working Group Governance

This document describes the governance model for all collaborative
working groups.

## Working Group Structure

Each working group consists of:

- Chair (1)
- Members (3-5)
- Observers (unlimited)

## Formation and Dissolution

Working groups are formed by the Core Guild and operate for an initial
6-month term. Working groups may be renewed based on progress evaluation
or dissolved upon completion of their charter objectives.

## Decision Making

Working groups operate on a consensus model, with formal decisions
requiring a simple majority vote of all members when consensus cannot
be reached.

## Meeting Requirements

Working groups must:

1. Meet at least bi-weekly
2. Use the standard meeting template
3. Post meeting minutes within 48 hours
4. Track action items and decisions

## Member Responsibilities

All working group members are expected to:

1. Attend meetings regularly
2. Complete assigned action items
3. Review pull requests in a timely manner
4. Communicate status updates to their respective organizations
